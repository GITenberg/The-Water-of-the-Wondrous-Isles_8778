description: "The Water of the Wondrous Isles is a fantasy novel by William Morris,\
  \ perhaps the first writer of modern fantasy to unite an imaginary world with the\
  \ element of the supernatural, and thus a precursor of much of present-day fantasy\
  \ literature. It was first printed in 1897 by Morris' own Kelmscott Press on vellum\
  \ and artisanal paper in a blackletter type of his own design. For the wider reading\
  \ public, a hardcover trade edition was published later that year by Longmans, Green\
  \ and Co. The novel's importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized\
  \ by its republication by Ballantine Books as the thirty-eighth volume of the celebrated\
  \ Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in November, 1971. The Ballantine edition includes\
  \ an introduction by Lin Carter.\nMorris considered his fantasies a revival of the\
  \ medieval tradition of chivalrous romances; in consequence, they tend to have sprawling\
  \ plots of strung-together adventures. These prose romances were written in a mock-Medieval\
  \ style that modern readers may find arduous and fustian.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
